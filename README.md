The tabs I had open while figuring this out:

* https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/protocol/#protocolregisterbufferprotocolscheme-handler-completion

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38573159/templating-in-electron

* https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/1-6-x/docs/api/protocol.md

Suffice it to say, I'm pretty happy with this and will be taking a nice little approach for nteract next. :smile:
